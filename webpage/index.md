# Auto-Taxi Algorithm for CSCI 716 - Computational Geometry 
By Audrey Fuller (alf9310@rit.edu), Ricky Gupta (rg4825@rit.edu) and Lauren Kaestle (lk2958@rit.edu)

Aircraft taxiing is a critical phase of flight, with over 80% of pilot-caused runway incursions occur during taxi to the departure runway [1](https://www.faa.gov/airports/runway_safety/pilots/best_practices). In this project, we use a geometric motion-planning aproach (exact algorithm TBD) to dynamically solve for a taxi route that is both fast and safe. 

## Background Information
* Brief introduction on what taxiing entails 

## Algorithm Inputs and Outputs
(Include visualization)

### Inputs:
* FAA Airport Diagram: Represented as a directed node graph
* Minimum turn radius and safe distance from obsticles
* Aircraft size
* Starting location and goal location

### Outputs:
* A set of 2D coorinate points showing the aircraft's path.

## Problem Domain
* Non-optimal solution is ok, as it's more important for it to stay within the safety margins

## Existing Research
* Include all of the research papers we looked through, and ones we took inspo from

## Algorithm Description
* Psudocode

## Example Results
* Path drawn over taxiiway

## Complexity Analysis 
* Running time for different inputs
